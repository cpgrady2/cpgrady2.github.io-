    <h3>What is the Jetta?</h3>
    <p1>The Volkswagen Jetta is a compact family car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen since 1979. Positioned to fill a sedan niche above the firm's Golf hatchback, it has been marketed over seven generations, variously as the Atlantic, Vento, Bora, City Jetta, Jetta City, GLI, Jetta, Clasico, and Sagitar (in China).
        The Jetta has been offered in two- and four-door saloon / sedan, and five-door wagon / estate versions all as four- or five-seaters. Since the original version in 1980, the car has grown in size and power with each generation. By mid-2011, almost 10 million Jettas have been produced and sold all over the world. As of April 2014, Volkswagen marketed over 14 million, becoming its top selling model.</p1>
    
   
<h4>History</h4>
      <p2>The Jetta body style was developed due in part to the Volkswagen marketing group's observation that the North American market leaned more towards sedans as opposed to the Golf's hatchback configuration. The new saloon variant was marketed as a more upscale car than its tailgated brethren, with nicer interior trim and a higher price. This proved to be a wise move on Volkswagen's part, as the Jetta became the best-selling European car in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Over the years, the car has been offered in two and four-door sedan and five-door station wagon variants. As of 2005, over 6.6 million cars have been sold worldwide, with over 2.2 million alone sold in the United States. Since the original version in 1980, the car has grown in size and power with each successive generation.</h2>

<p3>The Jetta has been around for decades, selling more than 17 million worldwide. The Jetta has historically been something of a premium offering in the compact-car class — priced accordingly — but that's changed in recent years as Volkswagen has looked to broaden the car's appeal in the U.S. Diesel and hybrid versions have been offered in the past, as well as a wagon body style, but it now comes only as a sedan powered by a turbocharged gas four-cylinder engine. Today there is now 7 generations of the jetta reaching back to the late 1970s. Each generation has featured its own unique features and designs, including sport trim levels known as the GLI (Grand Luxury Injection) model. Some models even include "Facelift" generations, such as the Mark 6.5 and Mark 7.5. These models only serve to make minor changes to the base model Jetta and GLI's appearence and performance while keeping the grand scheme of the vehicle the same as its generation.</p3>
